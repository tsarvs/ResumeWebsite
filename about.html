                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello, and welcome to my resume website. My name is Tom Sarver, and I am a senior Computer Engineering & Computer Science (CECS) major at the University of Louisville. I am pursuing my CECS degree along with a minor in Mathematics, and I intend to graduate from the University this upcoming Spring in May. As I am finishing up school, I am actively searching for an entry position in a company as a software engineer.
                        <br><br>
                        Although I have lived, worked, and gone to school in Louisville for the past five years, I am originally from the western suburbs of Chicago. I first learned to code during my junior year of high school, where I was taught the basic principles of object-oriented programming in one of my classes. Since then I have been constantly in pursuit of bettering my technical knowledge and coding skills. I have been particularly successful in this pursuit through efforts I have put into my academic career, my professional work, and my personal projects – such as this very website. I have learned so many things since when I first started programming, and I still have so much more to learn, but that’s what this website is all about.
                        <br><br>
                        Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the site.
                    </p>
