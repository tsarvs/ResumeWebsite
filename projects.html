                <p>River City Rocketry (RCR) is my university's very own student organization that builds rockets to compete in national competitions. Currently I am working on the Rocketry Telemetry Team. Here, my team and I are responsible with outfitting the rocket and deployable payload with computerized systems that will receive, transmit, and record real-time data from the launch. My personal project within the team is to create the ground station system that will be doing all of the signal reception from the rocket and payload. Once the data packets are correctly recepted from the respective source, the computer will log the data in a database. This allows engineers to not only go back and view the flight data from past launches, but also allows the telemetry team engineers to display the data on a webpage seamlessly.

                  <p>I have recently been partnered up with two other senior CECS students at UofL to create a software solution for one our client's (AAF International) back-end systems. The project revolves around converting a database application over to a completely new back-end platform and writing an acompanying UI. This project is still in its preliminary stages, and much of the design still has to be planned out, but stay tuned for updates to come!

                  <p>As part of a software engineering class, our semester-long project involved creating a cloud-based pantry management solution. Two computer engineering students and I worked together under SCRUM and Agile methodologies to develop a sysytem that would allow users to store the contents of their pantry in an online database, and the MyPantry management system would tell the user what possible recipes can be created with the ingredients they have logged.

                  <p>My friends and I love to play video games together, but a couple years back we got the idea to switch from video games to tabletop games. After a few months of playing our first tabletop game, a Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) campaign, I was inspired to run my own D&D campaign as the group's Dungeon Master (DM). A DM is responsible with writing adventures for their players to explore as well as facilitating the players' actions in the game. Through all of this adventure planning, I quickly came to realize the vast ammount of structured data that is used to play Dungeons and Dragons. As a DM myself, I wanted to develop a flexible yet applicable relational data schema that could help other DMs create and plan their very own campaigns.

                  <p>Creating a personal website is something that I have both wanted and planned to do for years now, each iteration taking on a new design and purpose. My first initial website design was tailored into acting as a file server for all of my documents, movies, and music. However, after multiple other iterations of the site were developed, it seemed best to create a site that could showcase my technical portfolio. While I do not consider myself an experienced web developer by any means, this has probably been one of the most fun projects for me because this site acts as a platform where I can apply my creativity and passion for coding to create something that is truly beautiful and representative of who I am. To me, this site represents much more than just a resume.

                  <p>Less than a year ago, I was moving out of my old apartment and into my current one. Before I moved, I had three other roomates, and when it came time to splitting up all of the items in the living room and kitchen, it was a mess. No one knew exactly what belonged to whom due to the ammount of time we all had lived together.
                  <br><br>
                  As apart of my Mobile Applications class' final project, I developed an Andriod app called RooMe that would help mitigate the stress of keeping track of items within a given household. This inventory management application would allow the user to keep track of not only all personal belongings but others' belongings as well.

                <div class="grid__content">
                  <p>The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a problem that is often studied in the realm of artificial intelligence. The problem entails finding the most efficient way to find the shortest/optimal path that intersects a set of two-dimensional vertices. While this seems simple for small sets, as the number of vertices increases so does the complexity of the problem. As part of the course content for my artificial intelligence class, students were assigned to develop a program throughout the semester that would solve sets of vertices. Initially the program I developed took a brute force approach, and calculated all possible combinations of vertices. However as the semester went along, students implemented multiple different approaches to solving these TSP sets including: greedy algorithms, genetic algorithms, and eventually hybrid algorithms (involving two algorithm architectures).
                  <br><br>
                  As a final project for the course, I explored the Job Shop Scheduling problem and implemented a program that would help solve problem sets. The job shop scheduling problem states that a program have one job scheduler machine and a list of jobs to schedule/execute, and the program has to organize the jobs in such a way that will minimize total delay of the entire schedule. My solution implemented a hyridized algorithm that drew logic from genetic algorithms and a wisdom of the crowds algorithm.

                <div class="grid__content">
                  <p>This project was given to me in my first few months at my co-op back in 2016. The company that I was working for had datacenters that would help manage eletronic protected health information (ePHI). When I first started with the company, they had just moved into a new and bigger office building, and so there were big new TV monitors set up all throughout the workplace. My project consisted of configuring several raspberry pis to display these dashboards on the tv that would give real time feedback on the efficiencies and inefficiencies of the datacenters and their infrastructure. 
                  <br><br>
                  Because I was setting up roughly 8 or so separate raspberry pis, I wanted to write a downloadable script that would streamline the process of configuring and booting up these dashboards. On top of that, I implemented a javascript file to rotate through multiple webpages, meaning that multiple data dashboards could be displayed on the same screen.
