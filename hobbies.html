                Indoor volleyball has always been a huge part of my life, as I have played every year since the fifth grade (13ish years ago). Throughout the years the sport has helped shape me into the person I am today. On one hand it has made me a fierce competitor in all aspects of work, but on the other hand it has taught me how to be a supportive teammate and thoughtful leader.

                Ever since my first video game console, gaming has always been a fun way for me to spend my time. Eventually my appreciation for video games grew enough to actually be what initially sparked my interest in programming back when I was in high school. Recently I have branched out to playing tabletop games such as the Dungeons & Dragons campaign I have with my friends. As the Dungeonmaster of the group, I find that designing the game and developing the plot of the story is a great way to explore the capabilities of ones' creativity and imagination.

                Beyond listening to music, I also like to collect CDs and vinyl. I have found that music can be one of my main sources of inspiration when it comes to tasks such as playing volleyball, working on school work, or even designing this site. On top of that, I also like to continually develop my home audio system by collecting hardware such as speakers, receivers, and audio players.
